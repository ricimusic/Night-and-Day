# Night-and-Day
Simple project for practice with css3 animations and javascript events.


Create a project where day changes into night by clicking the appropriate button on the footer. A variation could be to have a prompt appear when the window loads and then enter a keyword or a sentence containing a keyword, have javascript recognize that keyword, and then the change is made that way.

This project was inspired by Google Coder Projects from this link: http://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/night_and_day/

Goals: Document project with Readme file, utilize css animations that are triggered by javascript events.
